# Open Exchange Tickers

Part of the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning).

This is a small service for generating trading tickers that change price over time without any actual markets needing to exist.

Itâ€™s intended to behave like actual markets could and give the appearance of active markets.
